# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React Pokemon Application

Welcome to the React Pokemon Application! This project showcases the development of a React-based application that interacts with external APIs to fetch and display Pokemon data. Throughout this application, we will leverage the latest features of React, including hooks for state management and lifecycle effects, instead of relying on class components.

## Features

- Utilization of React hooks for state management and lifecycle effects
- Integration with external APIs to fetch Pokemon data
- User-friendly interface to explore and view Pokemon information

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Hooks
- Axios (or any other library for making HTTP requests)
- CSS (or any CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install dependencies:
4. Start the development server:
The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a user interface that allows you to explore and view information about various Pokemon. The application will fetch data from external APIs and display relevant details such as the Pokemon's name, image, type, and other characteristics.

You can interact with the application by navigating through different sections or using search functionality (if implemented) to find specific Pokemon.
